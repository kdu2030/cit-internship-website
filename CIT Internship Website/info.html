				<h2>Common FAQs</h2>
				<p><b>What if I'm going on vacation?</b></p>
				<p>If a student's family is going on a planned vacation, it is the student's responsibility to contact his or her employer and inform them of their absence.</p>
				<p><b>What if the student is on vacation during an in-class meeting?</b></p>
				<p>If the student is absent during an in-class meeting, students can use a video call to attend the session. This also applies if a student is absent on the day of final presentations.</p>
				<p><b>If I have already completed my 160 hours before the course ends, do I still have to work?</b></p>
				<p>A student has to complete his or her commitment to his or her employer. Therefore, if you already have worked 160 hours, you still have to continue working until the course ends or your commitment is complete.</p>
				<p><b>Has any student not found an internship?</b></p>
				<p>Historically, every student (that has proactively sought an internship) has found an internship opportunity.</p>
				<p><b>Will the student get paid for his or her internship?</b></p>
				<p>While students might not get paid for their internships, non-paid positions also offer compensation for the student's work. For example, if the student is working for an university, the mentor (who is a college professor) could write a recommendation for the student when he or she is applying for college.</p>
				<p><b>Can my mentor be related to me?</b></p>
				<p>Mentors cannot be related to you. However, you can have a neighbor or a family friend provide an internship for you.</p>
				<p><b>What if I find a new organization willing to host an intern?</b></p>
				<p>If you find a new organization willing to host an intern, you will have to talk to email the internship packet to the mentor so that the organization knows what to expect. In addition, you have to make sure that the work that you're doing for the organization is 75% tech related. Finally, Mrs. Norris will have to speak to the mentor in a in-person meeting.</p>
				<p><b>Can an intern work at home?</b></p>
				<p>An intern CANNOT work at home for extended periods of time. He or she must work on site for his or her internship.</p>
